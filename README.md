# Experimental

These are my small experiments with C++ language and constructs.

## Templates

- **count_indirections** : indirection counter for pointers (also known as "star counter"); also works with smart pointers.
- **count_elements** : counter of elements of a certain value in small constant compile-time arrays.
- **binary_search** : recursive binary search algorithm implemented with template metaprogramming for static and dynamic arrays of a known size.

More experiments will be added, stay tuned!
